Things to do:
Check (only in index) 1.   Can you add the FRC logo (please find the new one online if you can, or use the attached for now if you can’t) into the footer along with the words: Winner’s Circle Robo Jockeys is an award winning second-year First Robotics Competition Team from Louisville, Kentucky

2.   Please add the color photo of last year’s robot, attached, to the 2014-15 Robot section,

Check 3.   Please fix the team’s WCRJ logo so it isn’t warped (it’s a bit wider than tall right now and should be a perfect circle.)

4.   Can you make the red of the site match the FIRST red, rather than our logo red? Our logo red color is a bit off right now – it’s not supposed to be so magenta, but rather crimson.

 
Also, please arrange the sponsor page so that Become a Sponsor comes first, then Current Sponsors second. Under Current Sponsors, please add the attached logos using the following setup and sizes:
1.   Please put UofL and FirstBuild at the top of the page nice and big (they are our leading sponsors) Huge size logos

2.   Put Dow, Big Ass Solutions, and Frank Design next (a bit smaller than the first two), Large logos

3.   Put FORD, UAW, Papa Johns, NASA, and NSF after that (a bit smaller), Medium logos

4.   At the bottom of the page put the rest of the logos (make these smaller please – they are minor sponsors) Small logos
